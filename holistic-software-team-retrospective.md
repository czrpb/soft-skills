## I would like to create a detail specification that documents how a retrospective ought to be done for a software team.

> Be sure to pull best practices from the following theories:
> 
> 1. Critical Realism
> 1. Care Ethics
> 1. Transformative Mediation

Here is a detailed specification for conducting a retrospective for a software team, incorporating best practices from Critical Realism, Care Ethics, and Transformative Mediation:

### Retrospective Specification

#### Purpose

The purpose of the retrospective is to foster continuous improvement, strengthen relationships, and align the team's practices with their values and goals. By incorporating principles from Critical Realism, Care Ethics, and Transformative Mediation, the retrospective aims to create a safe, inclusive, and growth-oriented environment.

#### Preparation

1. Schedule the retrospective at a time that accommodates all team members' schedules and energy levels.
1. Choose a neutral facilitator who is trained in the principles of Care Ethics and Transformative Mediation.
1. Communicate the purpose, agenda, and guidelines of the retrospective to all participants in advance.
1. Prepare necessary materials, such as flip charts, markers, and sticky notes.

#### Guidelines

1. Confidentiality: Everything discussed during the retrospective stays within the team.
1. Non-judgmental attitude: Focus on understanding and learning, not blaming or shaming.
1. Active listening: Give full attention to the speaker and seek to understand their perspective.
1. Equal participation: Encourage everyone to contribute and ensure all voices are heard.
1. Respect: Treat each other with kindness, empathy, and respect, acknowledging the inherent worth of each individual.

#### Agenda

1. Check-in (10 minutes)
   - Begin with a brief check-in to gauge participants' emotional states and foster a sense of connection.
   - Encourage participants to share how they are feeling and what they need to fully engage in the retrospective.
1. Review purpose and guidelines (5 minutes)
   - Reiterate the purpose of the retrospective and the agreed-upon guidelines.
1. Reflection (30 minutes)
   - Encourage participants to share their experiences, challenges, and successes since the last retrospective.
   - Use open-ended questions to explore the underlying factors that contribute to the team's experiences, drawing from Critical Realism's emphasis on understanding the deeper structures and mechanisms at play.
   - Create a safe space for vulnerability and emotional expression, in line with Care Ethics' focus on empathy and attentiveness to others' needs.
1. Identify themes and issues (15 minutes)
   - Facilitate a discussion to identify common themes and issues that emerge from the reflection.
   - Use Transformative Mediation techniques to reframe conflicts as opportunities for growth and to uncover the underlying needs and values of all parties involved.
1. Generate insights and action items (30 minutes)
   - Encourage the team to brainstorm potential solutions and action items that address the identified themes and issues.
   - Prioritize action items based on their potential impact and the team's capacity.
   - Ensure that the action items align with the team's values and goals, and that they consider the needs and well-being of all team members, in line with Care Ethics.
1. Closing and commitment (10 minutes)
   - Summarize the key insights and action items generated during the retrospective.
   - Obtain commitments from team members to follow through on the agreed-upon actions.
   - End with a closing activity that reinforces the team's sense of connection and shared purpose.

#### Follow-up

1. Document the key insights and action items from the retrospective and share them with the team.
1. Schedule follow-up meetings to review progress on the action items and make adjustments as needed.
1. Continuously monitor the team's well-being and relationships, and address any issues that arise with empathy and care.

By incorporating principles from Critical Realism, Care Ethics, and Transformative Mediation, this retrospective specification aims to create a holistic, growth-oriented, and relationship-centered approach to continuous improvement for software teams.

## While this is nice and good, it details the 2nd-to-last step of the retrospective: The coming together of the team to discuss.

> But, it is my belief that the retrospective investigator has much more to do before and after this to prepare and generate documentation to be used for the discussion and summarization and report-out to management.
> 
> Please detail the process/steps the person running the retrospective follows in order to have an effective and impactful retrospective.
> 
> I should think it includes, but not limited to and so please include and expand, the following:
> 
> 1. Preparation
>    1. Document gathering
>    1. Interviews with all relevant participants
> 1. Execution
>    1. Interview summarizations and review with each participant
>    1. Report and/or presentation generation and review for the mediation session
> 1. Follow-Up & Follow-Thru
>    1. Detailed list of relationships that need repairing
>    1. Detailed list of processes that need fixing
>    1. Final report and summarization to management
