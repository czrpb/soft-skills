<blockquote>
<p>But, it is my belief that the retrospective investigator has much
more to do before and after this to prepare and generate documentation
to be used for the discussion and summarization and report-out to
management.</p>
<p>Please detail the process/steps the person running the retrospective
follows in order to have an effective and impactful retrospective.</p>
<p>I should think it includes, but not limited to and so please include
and expand, the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Preparation
<ol type="1">
<li>Document gathering</li>
<li>Interviews with all relevant participants</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Execution
<ol type="1">
<li>Interview summarizations and review with each participant</li>
<li>Report and/or presentation generation and review for the mediation
session</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Follow-Up &amp; Follow-Thru
<ol type="1">
<li>Detailed list of relationships that need repairing</li>
<li>Detailed list of processes that need fixing</li>
<li>Final report and summarization to management</li>
