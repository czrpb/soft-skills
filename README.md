# Exploration of Soft Skills

This repo is where I explore and work to integration my various core method/systems and soft skills (interpersonal skills).

At the moment, it consists of discussions w/ Anthropic's Claude AI.

# Credit

To the extent there should be any recognition, yes it would be nice if you used my name: `Quentin Crain`.

Obviously, the bulk of the credit goes to humanity which is the "data" behind Claude.
